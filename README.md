## ‚åõ Introduction

The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the entire process of name-entity recognition(NER) from start to the end with Spacy. This notebook also explore pattern matching as an alternative to NER when there is a known small set of fixed values.

This will be a complete end-to-end demonstration of the entire process, including both labelling and model training.

In this notebook, we train a model to detect entities related to oil/petrol from this [public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mitusha/email-dataset) which contains a list of emails related to the oil industry. This is an over simplification because we want more generic entities, but it shows how pattern matching is a better alternative than NER in this case. To summarise, we will extract oil-related elements from email messages.

Below are the process perform in this notebook:

Read the emails data set which has an email per line.
- Label the emails with the OIL entity using [Doccano](https://doccano.github.io/doccano/tutorial/) labeling tool. This is a manual process.
- Save the labels in a text file as JSONL.
- Use spaCy Neural Network model to train a new statistical model.
- Save the model.
- Create a Spacy NLP pipeline and use the new model to detect oil entities never seen before.
- Finally, use pattern matching instead of a deep learning model to compare both method.
